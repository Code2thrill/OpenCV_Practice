    "As discussed in the video, we can combine erosion and dilation operations to perform some interesting operations on binary images. We can remove small black or white spots from a binary image. For example, we know that erosion removes white region and dilation adds white region. Thus, if we want to remove small white spots, we should perform erosion followed by dilation so that the smaller white spots are removed, whereas the bigger white blobs are unchanged. Similarly you can remove black spots using dilation followed by erosion.\n",
    "Again, weird as it may sound, these operations are also given some names : Opening and Closing.\n",
